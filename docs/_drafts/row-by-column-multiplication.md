explain what is row by column multiplication

it can be defined as composition of tensor product and tensor contraction

A_i_s B_s_j = C_i_j

where first index is upper, second is lower. summation convention is over equal indices.

by convention upper indices are used for vector columns

a_i_1 is the first column of A

C_i_j = a_i_1 b_1_j + â€¦ + a_i_N b_N_j
